I'm a London-based Software Developer, Distributed Systems Nerd, and Amateur Metalsmith. Some of my projects are hosted at <a href="http://www.github.com/paulbellamy">Github</a>.

Occasionally, [I blog](/), but not particulary often.

I respond to email at [paul.a.bellamy@gmail.com](mailto:paul.a.bellamy@gmail.com), but it's probably best to reach me on twitter as [@pyrhho](http://www.twitter.com/pyrhho). To reach me securely, please find my GPG key on [keybase.io/paulbellamy](https://keybase.io/paulbellamy).
