I'm a London-based Software Developer building amazing things at <a href="http://www.pachube.com/">Pachube</a>. I enjoy a nice cup of tea and I host some of my projects at <a href="http://www.github.com/paulbellamy">Github</a>.

Occasionally, [I blog](/), but usually only when I have something to announce.

I respond to email at [paul@paulbellamy.com](mailto:paul@paulbellamy.com), but it's probably best to reach me on twitter as [@pyrhho](http://www.twitter.com/pyrhho).
